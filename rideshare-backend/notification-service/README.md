# Notification Service

## Overview

The Notification Service is a pivotal component of the Ride-Sharing Application. It facilitates seamless communication with users by delivering notifications through multiple channels, such as email and Telegram. Built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, this service ensures scalability, maintainability, and a clean separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### MVC Architecture

The **MVC architecture** is implemented to ensure modularity and maintainability:

1. **Model**: Manages the data layer and defines how data is retrieved, processed, and stored.
2. **View**: Handles the presentation of notification results (e.g., logging or status responses).
3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the user request and the business logic, delegating responsibilities to the appropriate services.

This architecture allows for a clear separation of responsibilities, making the system easier to debug, extend, and maintain.

## Key Components

1. **Notification Controller**

   - Entry point for all incoming notification requests.
   - Validates request payloads to ensure required data is provided.
   - Delegates notification logic to the Notification Service.

2. **Notification Service**

   - Orchestrates notification logic and determines delivery channels.
   - Generates content and ensures delivery through the appropriate channel(s).
   - Implements error handling for robust notification processing.

3. **Notification Channels**
   - **Email (SMTP)**: Sends HTML-formatted emails using Nodemailer.
   - **Telegram**: Sends real-time messages via the Telegram Bot API.
   - Designed with extensibility in mind to support additional channels in the future.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Channel Notification**: Supports email, Telegram, and future integration with additional channels.
- **Customizable Templates**: Enables dynamic and user-specific content generation.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensures graceful degradation and channel-specific error management.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular structure supports future growth and functionality additions.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - Express.js (for routing and request handling)
  - Nodemailer (for email notifications)
  - Axios (for API calls, e.g., Telegram Bot API)
  - dotenv (for environment variable management)

---

## Environment Configuration

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` (Email credentials)
  - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (Telegram Bot API token)
  - Other environment-specific configurations.

---

## API Endpoints

### 1. Send Notification

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/notification`

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "chatId": "telegram_chat_456",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "carfound": "yes",
  "arrivingTime": "5 min"
}
```

**Response**:

- **Success**: `200 OK` with a success message.
- **Error**:
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected server issues.

---

## Notification Channels

### 1. Email Notification

- Utilizes **Nodemailer** with Gmail SMTP.
- Sends HTML-formatted emails with responsive designs.
- Templates are customizable for dynamic content delivery.

### 2. Telegram Notification

- Leverages the **Telegram Bot API** for real-time message delivery.
- Messages are formatted using Markdown for improved readability.
- Supports instant notifications with user-defined parameters.

---

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive logging of errors and exceptions.
- Graceful fallback mechanisms for failed notifications.
- Channel-specific error handling ensures isolated issues don't affect other channels.

---

## Scalability Considerations

- **Modular Design**: Allows the addition of new notification channels with minimal disruption.
- **Extensibility**: Easily configurable notification strategies to support business growth.
- **Load Management**: Optimized to handle high traffic and large volumes of notifications.

---

## Security Considerations

- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Keeps sensitive credentials secure.
- **Encrypted Communication**: Ensures all notifications are sent over HTTPS.
- **Access Control**: Restricts access to critical resources through secure API endpoints.

---

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Notification Logs**: Tracks all attempts, successes, and failures for auditing purposes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitors notification processing times and system health.
- **Error Tracking**: Captures detailed error information for debugging and resolution.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd notification-service
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file and populate it with the required configurations (e.g., SMTP credentials, Telegram Bot Token).

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Integration with push notification services.
- Support for SMS notifications via third-party APIs.
- Advanced notification scheduling and user preferences.
